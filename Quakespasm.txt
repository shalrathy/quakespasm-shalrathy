  1. About

  QuakeSpasm is a modern cross-platform Quake engine based on FitzQuake.

  It includes support for 64 bit CPUs and custom music playback, a new
  sound driver, some graphical niceities, and numerous bug-fixes and
  other improvements.

  Quakespasm utilizes SDL-1.2 or SDL2 frameworks, choose one which works
  best for you. SDL2 has nicer features, smoother mouse input and better
  support for newer operating systems, but no CD-ROM support.


  2. Downloads

  -  Project Downloads: http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/download.htm

  -  Latest code repository:
     https://sourceforge.net/p/quakespasm/quakespasm/ci/master/tree/

  -  Github mirror:
     https://github.com/sezero/quakespasm


  3. Hints

  Visit the FitzQuake homepage <https://celephais.net/fitzquake/> for a
  full run-down of the engine's commands and variables.

  -  To disable some changes, use "quakespasm -fitz"

  -  Quakespasm's custom data is stored in "quakespasm.pak". Install
     this file alongside your id1 directory to enable the custom console
     background and other minor features.

  -  For different sound backend drivers use :
     "SDL_AUDIODRIVER=DRIVER ./quakespasm"
     where DRIVER may be alsa, dsp, pulse, esd ...

  -  Shift+Escape draws the Console.

  -  From the console, use UP to browse the command line history and TAB
     to autocomplete command and map names.

  -  There is currently no CD Music volume support and SDL2 doesn't
     support CD audio. cd_sdl.c needs replacing with cd_linux.c,
     cd_bsd.c etc..

  -  In windows, alternative CD drives are accessible by
     "quakespasm -cddev F" (for example)

  -  Quakespasm allows loading new games (mods) on the fly with
     "game GAMENAME {-quoth/hipnotic/rogue}"

  -  Use "quakespasm -condebug" to save console log to "qconsole.log".
     SDL2 builds no longer generate stdout.txt/stderr.txt.


  Music Playback:

  Quakespasm can play various external music formats, including MP3, OGG
  and FLAC.

  -  Tracks should be named like "track02.ogg", "track03.ogg" ... (there
     is no track01) and placed into "Quake/id1/music".

  -  Unix users may need some extra libraries installed: "libmad" or
     "libmpg123" for MP3, and "libogg" and "libvorbis" for OGG.

  -  Use the "-noextmusic" option to disable this feature.

  -  As of 0.90.0, music is played back at 44100 Hz by default with no
     need to adjust "-sndspeed".

  -  See Quakespasm-Music.txt for more details.


  Controller Support:

  The SDL2 variant of Quakespasm supports Xbox 360 style game
  controllers.

  The default configuration uses the left analog stick for movement and
  the right for looking.

  If your controller doesn't work you can try placing this file
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt
  in your Quake directory, it is a community-maintained database that
  adds support for more controllers to SDL2.

  Controller Support - Cvars:

  -  joy_deadzone - Fraction of the stick travel to be deadzone, between
     0 and 1. Default 0.175.

  -  joy_deadzone_trigger - Fraction of trigger range required to
     register a button press on the analog triggers, between 0 and 1.
     Default 0.2.

  -  joy_sensitivity_yaw/pitch - Max angular speed in degrees/second
     when looking. Defaults are 300 for yaw (turning left/right) and 150
     for pitch (up/down).

  -  joy_exponent - For the look stick, the stick displacement (between
     0 and 1) is raised to this power. Default is 3. A value of 1 would
     give a linear relationship between stick displacement and fraction
     of the maximum angular speed.

  -  joy_invert - Set to 1 to invert the vertical axis of the look
     stick.

  -  joy_swapmovelook - Set to 1 to swap the left and right analog stick
     functions. Default 0, move on the left stick, look on the right
     stick.

  -  joy_enable - Set to 0 to disable controller support. Default 1.

  Controller Support - Buttons:

  Some of the controller buttons are hardcoded to allow navigating the
  menu:

  -  Back - alias for TAB
  -  Start - alias for ESC
  -  DPad, analog sticks - mapped to arrow keys
  -  A Button - alias for ENTER in menus
  -  B Button - alias for ESC in menus

  These buttons can be bound normally:

  -  LTRIGGER - Left trigger
  -  RTRIGGER - Right trigger
  -  LSHOULDER - Left shoulder button
  -  RSHOULDER - Right shoulder button
  -  LTHUMB - Clicking the left thumbstick
  -  RTHUMB - Clicking the right thumbstick
  -  ABUTTON
  -  BBUTTON
  -  XBUTTON
  -  YBUTTON

  quakespasm.pak contains a default.cfg which has been updated to give
  some default bindings. L/R shoulder buttons are bound to weapon
  switching, and L/R triggers are jump and attack.

  The controller support started as Jeremiah Sypult's implementation in
  Quakespasm-Rift, and also uses ideas/code from LordHavoc's DarkPlaces.


  4. Compiling and Installation

  See the Downloads section to get the sourcecode, then below for
  platform specific instructions.  Quakespasm can also be built with the
  cross-platform Codeblocks.
  Quakespasm's (optional) custom data is now stored in the file
  quakespasm.pak. This file should be placed alongside your quakespasm
  binary and id1 directory.

  Compiling for Linux/Unix:

  After extracting the source tarball, "cd Quake" and edit the Makefile
  for music options.

  Streaming music playback requires "libmad" or "libmpg123" for MP3, and
  "libogg" and "libvorbis" for OGG files.

  Then type "make" to compile the program, and copy the "quakespasm"
  binary (and "quakespasm.pak") to your Quake game directory.
  Compile time options include

  -  make DO_USERDIRS=1 to include user directories support

  -  make DEBUG=1 for debugging

  -  make SDL_CONFIG=/PATH/TO/sdl-config for unusual SDL installations

  -  make USE_SDL2=1 to compile against SDL2 instead of SDL-1.2

  Compiling for Windows:

  QuakeSpasm developers cross-compile windows binaries using MinGW-w64
  <http://mingw-w64.sf.net> and MinGW <https://mingw.osdn.io>.  The
  project can also be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and newer
  versions.

  Compiling for Mac OS X:

  A Quakespasm App (including program launcher and update framework) can
  be made using the Xcode template found in the MacOSX directory.

  Alternatively, have a look at Makefile.darwin for more instructions on
  building from a console.


  Quake '2021 re-release':

  QuakeSpasm 0.94 has support for playing the 2021 re-release content:
  Copy the quakespasm binary to your rerelease installation and run as
  you normally do.

     merge (sf.net bug/50)


  Changes in 0.94.0:

  -  Initial support for playing the 'Quake 2021 re-release' content
     (thanks to Andrei Drexler for bulk of the work, Guillaume Plourde
     for Q64 bsp format support.)

     lits, etc)

  -  External ent files are now versioned using 4 digit crc of the
     original map's ents, like e1m1@c49d.ent, which is much safer. The
     old method (e.g. e1m1.ent) still works but isn't recommended.

  -  Fixed several uncheked limits that would crash the Slayer's
     Testaments mod (sf.net bug #33).

  -  Raised MAXALIASTRIS from 2048 to 4096, so that the Slayer's
     Testaments mod works.

  -  Fixed 'pants' and 'shirt' types so that those textures load
     correctly on platforms where char type is unsigned by default
     (sf.net bug #28).

  -  Windows audio: WASAPI-enabled SDL2 dlls function properly now.

  -  Update the third-party libraries. Other fixes/cleanups.

     "joy_exponent_move" cvar.

  -  config.cfg is no longer written in case of a Sys_Error.

  -  Fixed Opus encoded cd tracks not being recognized as ripped tracks.

  -  Update the third-party libraries. Other fixes/cleanups.

  -  Change "games" / "mods" commands to list all subdirectories.

  -  Restore vid_refreshrate from fitzquake-0.85 for SDL2 builds.

  -  Alpha-masked model support. (MF_HOLEY: 0x4000).

  -  Invalid skin index now draws skin 0 (WinQuake behaviour) instead of
     blue checkerboard.

  -  Change default screenshot format to png. The 'screenshot' command
     now supports optional format (tga, png or jpg) and quality (1-100)
     arguments.

  -  Revert "always run" changes from 0.85.9 and move the QuakeSpasm
     customizations to a new "cl_alwaysrun" cvar: Set to 1 in order to
     scale forward/side/up speed by "cl_movespeedkey" (usually 2), and
     to make "speedkey" act as "slowkey".

  -  Change the "always run" menu option to offer three choices:
     off        (cl_alwaysrun 0, cl_forwardspeed 200, cl_backspeed 200)
     vanilla    (cl_alwaysrun 0, cl_forwardspeed 400, cl_backspeed 400)
     quakespasm (cl_alwaysrun 1, cl_forwardspeed 200, cl_backspeed 200)

     (from MarkV).

  -  New "find" / "apropos" command, searches for commands/cvar names
     for the given substring (from Spike).

  -  New "randmap" command for loading a random map.

  -  New "gl_cshiftpercent_contents", "gl_cshiftpercent_damage",
     "gl_cshiftpercent_bonus", "gl_cshiftpercent_powerup" cvars for
     tuning the strength of specic view blends.

  -  GL2 renderer: use a GLSL shader for world faces. Fixes reports of
     integrated+discrete GPU laptops having inconsistent fog rendering.

  -  Fix macOS startup delay (avoid calling gethostbyname() for ".local"
     hostnames).

  -  Fix memory corruption in PF_lightstyle with out of bounds
     lightstyles.

  -  Fix crash in BoundPoly with polygons extending beyond +/-9999.

  -  Fix QS window to stay on the current monitor when changing video
     modes (SDL2 only).

  -  Update the third-party libraries.


  Changes in 0.92.1:

  -  Fixed large menu scale factors (was broken in 0.92.0).

  -  Fixed PAUSE key (was broken in 0.92.0).

  -  Updated some of the third-party libraries.


  Changes in 0.92.0:

  -  SDL2 Game Controller support.

  -  Contrast support with new "contrast" cvar, behaving the same as
     MarkV. It may be a useful alternative to the existing gamma control
     for laptops in a bright environment, etc. Raising contrast gives
     less of a gray/washed out look than raising gamma, but at a
     disadvantage: colors near white get clipped to white.

  -  RMQ protocol (999) support, adapted from RMQEngine.

  -  New "-protocol x" command line option. Accepted values for 'x' are
     15 (NetQuake), 666 (FitzQuake, default), and 999 (RMQ).

  -  New "setpos" console command.

  -  New "vid_borderless" cvar for getting a borderless window.

  -  Increased MAX_MAP_LEAFS from 65535 to 70000 and MAX_LIGHTMAPS from
     256 to 512 in order to handle the oms3 map pack.

  -  Server edicts are now allocated using malloc instead of allocating
     on the hunk.

  -  gl_clear now defaults to 1.

  -  Fix items falling out of the world on oms3.bsp on SSE builds.

  -  Worked around an OSX 10.6 driver bug when using FSAA, which was
     leading to an unplayable HOM effect on the rest of the screen.

  -  Fix wrong trace endpoint from the tracepos console command.

  -  Updated some of the third-party libraries. Other fixes/clean-ups.


  Changes in 0.91.0:

  Bugfixes:

  -  Fix unwanted fog mode change upon video restart.

  -  Work around Intel 855 bug in status bar drawing with "r_oldwater 0"
     and "scr_sbaralpha 0".

  -  Fix an obscure GLSL bug where changing gamma would result in the
     screen turning to noise.

  -  Fix GLSL gamma causing the tiled screen border to turn white when
     "sizedown" is used.

  -  Fix an alias model VBO renderer bug where a model not precached
     during map start wouldn't be drawn.

  -  Fix the order of OpenGL context creation and window creation in
     SDL2 video.

  -  Fix a calling convention issue in windows DPI awareness function
     pointers.

  -  Fix a liquid turning to garbage after several video mode changes
     and "r_oldwater 0".

  -  Fix a wrong alpha-sorting bug introduced in 0.90.1.

  -  Fix "flush" command not reloading mdl's from disk (bug introduced
     in 0.90.1).

  -  Prevent a possible buffer overflow in Cbuf_Execute (old Q1/Q2 bug).

  -  Prevent a possible vulnerability in MSG_ReadString (old Q1/Q2 bug).

  Visual improvements:

  -  New cvars r_lavaalpha, r_slimealpha, r_telealpha for fine-tuning
     specific liquid opacities (from DirectQ/RMQEngine, non-archived,
     default to 0), and new worldspawn keys _wateralpha, _lavaalpha,
     _slimealpha, _telealpha, _skyfog (unique to Quakespasm, similar to
     the behaviour of the "fog" worldspawn key).

  -  GLSL gamma is now supported on older hardware without NPOT
     extension.

  Interface improvements:

  -  New r_pos command to show player position.

  -  NaN detection in traceline with "developer 1" set now warns instead
     of errors.

  Code cleanup / Other:

  -  Update third-party libraries.

  Raised limits:

  -  Default max_edicts 8192 (was 2048) and no longer saved to
     config.cfg.

  -  Default heapsize 256 MB (was 64 MB).

  -  Default zone 4 MB (was 384 KB).

  -  Raised MAX_SFX to 1024 (was 512).


  Changes in 0.90.1:

  Bugfixes:

  -  Fix dynamic light artifact where changing lightmap are rendered one
     frame late (bug introduced in 0.90.0).

  -  Fix texture memory leak when changing video modes with SDL2.

  -  Fix a rare incorrect mdl lighting on 64-bit builds. (details here:
     https://forums.insideqc.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5620)

  -  Fix fullbrights turning black after "kill" command (bug introduced
     in 0.90.0).

  -  Clear all fog values on map change to prevent colored fog carrying
     over to jam3_tronyn.bsp.

  -  Allow loading saves with } character in quoted strings, fixes issue
     with retrojam1_skacky.bsp.

  -  Fix viewmodel not lerping on extended-limit maps.

  -  Fix crash on out-of-bounds skin number.

  Performance:

  -  Use multithreaded OpenGL on OS X for better performance.

  -  New, faster mdl renderer using GLSL. Disable with "-noglslalias".

  Visual improvements:

  -  New gamma correction implementation using GLSL. Fixes all known
     gamma issues (affecting the full display, persisting after
     quitting, or darkening the screen on OS X). Disable with
     "-noglslgamma".

  -  Use high-quality water by default (r_oldwater 0).

  -  Shadows use stencil buffer to avoid overlapping artifacts (from
     MarkV.)

  -  r_noshadow_list cvar added (from MarkV.)

  Interface improvements:

  -  Support pausing demo playback with the "pause" command.

  -  Autocompletion for "game", "record", "playdemo".

  -  Experimental windowed fullscreen mode available with
     vid_desktopfullscreen 1 (only in SDL2 builds, takes effect upon
     entering fullscreen mode the next time.)

  -  Silence "exceeded standard limit" messages unless developer cvar is
     >= 1.

  -  Some spam moved from developer 1 to 2: "can't find tga/lit/ent",
     "trying to load ent", "bad chunk length", "meshing",
     "PR_AlocStringSlots: realloc'ing"

  Code cleanup:

  -  Clean up IDE project files to build on fresh systems.

  -  Update 3rd-party libraries.


  Changes in 0.90.0:

  -  Fix issues on Windows systems with DPI scaling.

  -  Unix/Mac user directories support. Disabled by default,
     'make DO_USERDIRS=1' to enable it.

  -  SDL2 support. Disabled by default, 'make USE_SDL2=1' to enable it.

  -  Revised keyboard input code.

  -  Revised/improved the 'game' command, i.e. on-the-fly mod changing.
     It now accepts an optional second argument for mission packs or
     quoth support i.e. -hipnotic, -rogue, or -quoth. For example, for
     WarpSpasm: "game warp -quoth"

  -  Command line: "-game {quoth/hipnotic/rogue}" is now treated the
     same as -quoth, -hipnotic, or -rogue.

  -  Console speed now resolution-independent.

  -  Disabled gl_zfix, which caused glitches and is undesirable for new
     maps. Replacement .ent files to fix z-fighting for several id1 maps
     added to quakespasm.pak.

  -  PF_VarString buffer bumped to 1024, avoids truncated centerprints
     from the 'In The Shadows' mod.

  -  Support for opengl non-power-of-two-textures extension (disable
     with command line: "-notexturenpot".)

  -  Support for OpenGL vertex buffer objects (VBO, OpenGL 1.5 or newer)
     for world and brush models (disable with command line: "-novbo".)

  -  Antialiasing (FSAA) support (command line: -fsaa x, where x can be
     0, 2, 4, 8).

  -  Fence textures support.

  -  Dynamic light speedup. Speedup loading of tga and pcx external
     images.

  -  Brush model drawing speedup.

  -  Support for BSP2 and 2PSB map formats.

  -  Support for Opus, FLAC, and tracker music (S3M, IT, UMX, etc.), as
     compile-time options.

  -  Music and sfx now mixed at 44100 Hz to avoid downsampling music.
     Low-pass filter applied to the sfx if -sndspeed is 11025 (the
     default), to preserve the same sound quality as 0.85.9.  New
     -mixspeed option sets the rate for mixing sfx and music, and output
     to the OS (default 44100), setting it to 11025 reverts to 0.85.9
     behaviour. New snd_filterquality cvar, value can be between 1
     (emulate OS X resampler) and 5 (emulate Windows resampler),
     controls the sound of the low-pass filter.

  -  Better Hor+ field of view (FOV) scaling behavior.

  -  Better cross-map demo playback support.

  -  Fix screenshots when screen width isn't a multiple of 4.

  -  Fix a lighting glitch due to floating point precision.

  -  Fix a looping sounds glitch.

  -  Fix a vulnerability in file extension handling. Tighten path
     handling safety.

  -  Initialize opengl with 24-bit depth buffer at 32 bpp.

  -  Reset all models upon gamedir changes. (Fixes failures with mods

     crashes with excessively long global strings seen in some rude
     mods.
